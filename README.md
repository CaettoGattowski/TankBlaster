This is a small sample of a puzzle dungeon escape game I made by studying and applying all the knowledge i got from a Udemy Course by Kaan Alpar, all rights reserved. All assets were free from the FAB store. Assets where: Medieval Dungeon and UE starter content.

In this game i learnt the following topics:

- Player Tank Controlled with Input
  
- Enemy turrets that can detect the player
  
- Projectile firing system
  
- Health, Damage and Destruction
  
- Win and Lose condition with UI
  
- Special Effects like particles, sounds and camera shake
